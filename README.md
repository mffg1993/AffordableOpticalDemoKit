# AffordableOpticalDemoKit

An open-source collection of **instructions, 3D-printable models, and guidelines** for building affordable optical demonstration kits.  
The goal is to make optics (and later, broader physics) education more accessible in regions with limited resources.

## ✨ Features
- 3D-printable models for optical components and mounts  
- Step-by-step assembly instructions  
- Low-cost alternatives to standard optics lab elements  
- Designs focused on accessibility and reproducibility  
- Open to contributions and improvements  

---

## 🎯 Purpose
Optics education often requires expensive equipment that is out of reach for many schools and communities.  
This project provides **affordable, easy-to-build kits** that allow teachers, students, and volunteers to demonstrate  
fundamental optical principles without prohibitive costs.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `/models` → STL/3D printing files for optical elements and mounts  
- `/instructions` → Assembly guides and teaching notes  
- `/examples` → Suggested classroom experiments and demos  
- `/scripts` → Optional helper code (if needed)
